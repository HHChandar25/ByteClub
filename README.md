# Magnetic & Electric Fields Demo  
**Interactive Physics Simulation for Education — Built in TypeScript** 

This project is a **science-based interactive demo** designed to teach the fundamentals of **magnetic and electric fields** through a visual and experimental environment.  
Users can interact with magnets/charges, spawn particles, and observe attraction/repulsion forces in real time.

📅 Presentation Deadline: **Dec 12**  
👤 Developer: Guilherme Henriques

##  Core Objectives

- Demonstrate **magnetic & electric field behavior visually**
- Allow users to **experiment** with particles and charges
- Teach science through **interaction instead of explanation**
- Create a **polished tutorial demo** for educational use
